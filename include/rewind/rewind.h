/*
 * Queue of rewind items internals:
 * --------------------------------
 *                                                                                               F R
 *  |      C+++++++R++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++E++++++++++++A.A       |
 *  C - completePos, R-restorePos, E-evictPos, AF - addPosFilled, AR - addPosReserved
 *  " " - empty items, "+" - busy items, "." - transient items
 *  All positions are uint64 and can only increase.
 *  E and R are modified only under lock.
 *  C can only be increased by the only rewind worker and is not locked.
 *  A(F) and A(R) - are atomic uint64 as they are accessed concurrently by adding backends at commit transaction.
 *
 *  All readable items are from C to AF. Between AF and AR some items are transiently not filled, so they
 *   are not readable by evict/restore/complete/rewind. But up to A(R) position they are is considered "busy"
 *   and A(R) is used for calculation of free space for eviction.
 *
 * Tail and head of this queue are placed into in-memory buffers completeBuffer and addBuffer.
 * They use modulo placement so every time ( R-C < buffer_length ) and ( AR - E < buffer_length).
 *
 *     |      C+++++R      |        or alternatively         |++++R      C+++++|
 *
 *                  F R                                            F R
 *       |      E+++A.A      |      or alternatively           |+++A.A      E+++++|
 *
 * Positions between R and E are written to disk (in full blocks only).
 *
 * There are following actions on a queue:
 *  - Adding: to addBuffer, done by committing backends
 *  - Eviction: from addBuffer, done by committing backends
 *  - Restore: to completeBuffer, done by a rewind worker
 *  - Rewind: from all buffers, done by a backend where rewind is requested. All other backends are shut down
 *  before actual Rewind starts.
 *  - Complete: from completeBuffer, done by a rewind worker
 *
 *  Adding to addBuffer:
 *  (1) checks is the space enough, if not calls eviction first
 *  (2) reserves space to addind by incrementing AR
 *  (3) adds items to the reserved space:
 *
 * Rewind queue items has two types
 *  - rewindItem: mandatory for each transaction commit
 *  - subxidsItem: optional, when subxids exist for a transaction.
 *
 * All items for the same transaction are written together in the following order:
 *  rewindItem->subxidsItem(1)->...->subxidsItem(n). This is crucial for proper backwards reading during Rewind.
 *
 *  (4) pushes AF:
 *   - if all concurrent backends that incremented AR finished
 *   - if transient difference AR-AF becomes big (then transaction waits concurrent ones to complete)
 *
 * Eviction from addBuffer has two ways:
 * - fast: direct transfer from addBuffer to completeBuffer (in there is space for this)
 * - ordinary: items written to disk and cleared from addBuffer (by full blocks)
 *
 * Restore to completeBuffer also has two ways:
 * - ordinary: if some items are evicted to disk but not restored yet. So they are read from disk to free
 *  space in conpleteBuffer (by full blocks);
 * - fast: - if items are only in in-memory buffers. So they are directly transferred from addBuffer to
 *  completeBuffer.
 *
 * At Rewind, backend reads all existing items from both in-memory buffers and on-disk buffer in reverse
 * so from AF to C. Only one backend remains at the time of do_rewind() starts so it works only serially and doesn't
 * need locks. RewindWorker applies undoChain from each item and restores global variables relevant to heap
 * transaction visibility. Rewind stops (1) on reaching specified xid/oxid pair or time values (2) on reaching
 * completePos, so maximum depth of rewind is limited by a rewind buffer.
 *
 * At Complete, rewind worker fix both Oriole and heap transactions remembered in queue rewindItems from C to AF.
 * This is done serially but may require restore action when completeBuffer frees enough. Restore takes evictLock
 * to avoid concurrent eviction by backends.
 *
 * Eviction has two locks:
 * 	rewindEvictLock - against concurrent eviction (1) and eviction during restore (2). Only backend that got
 * 	eviction lock does eviction, others skip and do not wait.
 *
 * 	rewindCheckpointLock - against eviction during checkpoint. All backends that couldn't get it wait until
 * 	checkpoint releases the lock.
